# Learning Flutter
This repository contains my projects and experiments as I learn Flutter. 

## Project
### Namer App
A simple Flutter app that generates random names. This project helped me get familiar with basic Flutter widgets and state management.

## Setup
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learningFlutter.git
```
- Navigate to the namer_app folder and run the app:
```bash
cd namer_app
flutter run
```
